#review question 2
'''
Which of the following is FALSE? and explain why it is FALSE.
(1) Stemming is a component of text processing that captures the relationships between
different variations of a word.
(2) Stemming reduces the different forms of a word that occur because of inflection (e.g.,
plurals, tenses) or derivation (e.g., making a verb into a noun by adding the suffixation)
to a common stem.
(3) In general, using a stemmer for search applications with English text produces a small but
noticeable improvement in the quality of results.
(4) A dictionary-based stemmer uses a small program to decide whether two words are
related, usually based on knowledge of word suffixes for a particular language

answer is 4 

stemming is a process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root formâ€”generally a written word form.
a dictionary-based stemmer uses a dictionary of words to determine the stem of a word. it has no sense of logic or rules
